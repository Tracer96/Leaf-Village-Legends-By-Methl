# 🍃 Leaf Village Legends

**A comprehensive guild contribution tracker and gamification addon for World of Warcraft (Vanilla / Classic 1.12).**

The Leaf Village Legends addon transforms our guild experience by tracking member contributions, awarding badges, managing leaderboards, and fostering community engagement — all themed around the Naruto-inspired Leaf Village guild hierarchy.

## ✨ Features

### 🏅 Leaf Points System
- **Automatic point tracking** across multiple activities: daily logins, quest completions, boss kills, dungeon runs, and grouping with guildmates.
- **Three point categories:**
  - **L (Login)** — Earned from daily logins and login streaks.
  - **G (Gameplay)** — Earned from quests, dungeons, raids, and boss kills.
  - **S (Social)** — Earned from shoutouts and guild social interactions.
- **Configurable daily caps** to keep earning balanced and fair.
- **Alt character pooling** — Link alt characters to a main so Gameplay and Social points accumulate on one identity. Login points remain per-character.

### 🎖️ Badge Collection
Over 20 collectible badges across 6 categories, each with WoW-style quality tiers:

| Quality | Color | Examples |
|---------|-------|----------|
| ⬜ **Common** | Gray | First Steps, Team Player, Generous Soul |
| 🟩 **Uncommon** | Green | Dedicated, Groupie, Raider, Well Known |
| 🟦 **Rare** | Blue | Truly Dedicated, Social Butterfly, Core Member, Raid Veteran |
| 🟪 **Epic** | Purple | Guild Hero, Guild Elite |
| 🟧 **Legendary** | Orange | Hokage Legend, One Year Legend |

**Badge categories include:**
- **Activity** — Login streaks and consistency.
- **Social** — Grouping with guildmates.
- **Recognition** — Giving and receiving shoutouts.
- **Milestones** — Total Leaf Point thresholds.
- **Raids** — Raid attendance tracking.
- **Loyalty** — Time spent in the guild (30 days, 90 days, 1 year).

Badges are **auto-tracked** and awarded with in-game toast notifications, chat announcements, and clickable badge hyperlinks.

### 🏆 Leaderboards
- **All-Time Leaderboard** — Lifetime total Leaf Points across all members.
- **Weekly Leaderboard** — Resets each week for competitive seasons.
- **Achievement Leaderboard** — Tracks completed in-game achievements.
- **Seasonal rewards** — Configurable gold rewards for top-placing members each season.
- **Guild-wide syncing** via addon messaging (`GUILD` channel) — leaderboard data is shared and merged across all online members.

### 📣 Shoutout System
- Give shoutouts to guildmates for recognition.
- Shoutouts award Leaf Points to the receiver.
- Autocomplete target suggestions from the guild roster.
- Shoutout history is synced across guild members.

### 🎯 Achievement Tracking
- Integrates with the companion achievement addon (`LeafVE_AchTest`) for tracking Classic WoW achievements (professions, leveling, PvP, raids, and more).
- Per-player achievement popups with detailed progress.
- Achievement icons mapped for dozens of Classic milestones.

### 🗂️ Guild Roster & Player Cards
- View the full guild roster with rank, level, class, and online status.
- **Player Cards** display a member's Leaf Points breakdown, earned badges (with quality-colored tooltips), and activity history.
- Click any guild member to inspect their profile.

### 🔔 Notification System
- Elegant toast-style pop-up notifications for badge unlocks, point gains, and achievements.
- Configurable toggles for notification categories (points, badges, sound).
- Notification queue system so alerts never overlap.

### ⚙️ Admin Panel
Restricted to guild leadership ranks (**Hokage**, **Sannin**, **Anbu**):
- Adjust point values for logins, quests, bosses, dungeons, shoutouts, and grouping.
- Configure daily caps, cooldowns, and seasonal rewards.
- **Broadcast settings** to all guild members in a single click.
- Hard reset leaderboards, badges, or achievement data.
- Award or remove badges from individual players.

### 🔗 Data Sync

- Automatic resync requests on login or UI open.
- Cooldown-protected broadcasts to prevent channel spam.
- Badge, shoutout, and achievement data all sync independently.
